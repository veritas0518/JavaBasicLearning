# JavaBasicLearning
This is a library about java basic and advanced learning, including arrays, linked lists, collections, concurrency, IO streams, dynamic numbers, dynamic agents and so on. 
Interested people can fork my library or star my library. I will update my log every day. 
This is only the first part of my journey to learn Java, followed by spring, springboot and springcloud.
